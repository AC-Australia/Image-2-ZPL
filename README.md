# Image-2-ZPL
.NET Library that converts BMP, JPG, and PNG images into a ZPLII string for printing on Zebra printers without uploading an image to the printer.

This can be used to add customized barcodes or images. Best results with images that can look fine in black and white.

For testing without a Zebra printer, use this site for testing your ZPL markup. http://labelary.com/viewer.html
